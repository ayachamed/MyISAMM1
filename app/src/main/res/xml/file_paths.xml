        This configuration allows FileProvider to share files from your app's cache directory.
        - 'name="shared_cache"': An arbitrary name for this path. You can choose something descriptive.
        - 'path="."': Specifies the root of the cache directory.
                       getContext().getCacheDir() corresponds to this.
    -->
    <cache-path
        name="shared_cache"
        path="." />

    <!--
        Optionally, if you plan to download files to your app's internal files directory
        (accessed via getContext().getFilesDir()), you can add a <files-path> element.
    -->
    <!--
    <files-path
        name="shared_files"
        path="." />
    -->

    <!--
        Optionally, if you were to save files to a specific subdirectory within the cache or files directory,
        you could specify that subdirectory in the 'path' attribute.
        For example, if files are in "my_materials/" subdirectory of the cache:
    -->
    <!--
    <cache-path
        name="material_cache_subdir"
        path="my_materials/" />
    -->

    <!--
        If you ever need to share files from external storage (public directories),
        you would use <external-path />, <external-files-path />, or <external-cache-path />.
        However, for opening files downloaded by your app, cache or files directory is usually preferred.
        Example for public 'Downloads' directory (use with caution and appropriate permissions):
    -->
    <!--
    <external-path
        name="external_downloads"
        path="Download/" />
    -->

</paths>
